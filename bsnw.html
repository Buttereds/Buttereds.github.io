# About Project

VR Training on Bag Searching and Wanding for Security Trainees. This module allows you to experience what it is like to do a check on unsafe patrons, and how to handle items when they are found. This allows the user to learn and adapt when something is happening, and helps show correct procedures for when this does happen.
